Hi, I’m Wei Chen. I did my undergraduate studies at the School of Health Humanities, Peking University, and I’m now a master’s student at Peking University Third Hospital.

Academically, I’m what people kindly call a “free-range researcher”—I currently have exactly one manuscript under review, which I cherish like an only child. On the bright side, I did pass TEM-8, so at least my English is more reliable than my publication record.

Outside the lab, I’m the captain of the Peking University Bodybuilding Team, where I lift both weights and team morale. I’ve competed a bit too:

	•	Overall Champion in Fitness Model, Peking University’s First Fitness & Bodybuilding Championships
	
	•	1st place, Fitness Model (Group B), 14th Beijing Sport University Fitness & Bodybuilding Championships

	•	3rd place, Men’s Physique (Group E), 19th Capital University Fitness & Bodybuilding Championships
	
	•	4th place, Men’s Physique (Group E), 20th Capital University Fitness & Bodybuilding Championships

In short: mild academic chaos, strong English, and even stronger delts.
